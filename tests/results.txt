\ Modified by SamCo 2018-05 for testing Tali Forth 2.  ok
\ The main change is lowercasing all of the words as Tali  ok
\ is case sensitive, as well as replacing tabs with spaces.  ok
\ A word to display the actual (erroneous) results was also added.  ok
\ Modified by SamCo 2018-10 to facilitate using standard ANS tests.  ok
\ The testing words were changed from { and } to T{ and }T to  ok
\ match the testing words currently being used by ANS standard tests.  ok
