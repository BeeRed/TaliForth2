; COMPILE WORDS, JUMPS and SUBROUTINE JUMPS INTO CODE

; These three routines compile instructions such as "jsr xt_words" into a word
; at compile time so they are available at run time. Words that use this
; routine may not be natively compiled. We use "cmpl" as not to confuse these
; routines with the COMPILE, word. Always call this with a subroutine jump.
; This means combining JSR/RTS to JMP in those cases is not going to work. To
; use, load the LSB of the address in A and the MSB in Y. You can remember
; which comes first by thinking of the song "Young Americans" ("YA") by David
; Bowie.
