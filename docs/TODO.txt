        - Add native compile depending on word size
        - Check if we really use all the strings (ie ">>>ERROR<<<")
        - In ALLOT, figure out how to handle release of too much memory

        - Add special cases to native compile routine
        - Add SEE as a native word

        - See if we can add real Delete Key detection (ESC[3~)
        - Add more words from the ANSI String list
        - Add STRIP-UNDERFLOW option to remove underflow checks during native
          compilation (add a new UF flag in headers)
