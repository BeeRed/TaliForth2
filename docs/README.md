# Documentation for Tali Forth 2 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

Tali Forth's documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled to other versions
with the following commands: 

- HTML: `asciidoctor -a toc=left manual.adoc`
- PDF:  `asciidoctor-pdf -v manual.adoc`

The `docs` folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably looking for
are the `manual.html`, `manual.pdf` and possibly the `WORDLIST.md` files. The
last two files in the folder are generated by the Ophis assembler and contain
the listing and symbols used.

The `TODO.txt` list is not always up to date, see the list of issues on the
GitHub home of Tali Forth 2.
