# Documentation for Tali Forth 2 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

This folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably looking for are
the `manual.pdf` and possibly the `WORDLIST.md` files. The last two files in
the folder are generated by the Ophis assembler and contain the listing and
symbols used.  If you are *really* motivated and want a good laugh, checkout
out `TODO.txt`. 

Most of the other stuff just belongs to the LaTeX tool chain.
