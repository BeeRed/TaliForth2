Tali Forth would never have been possible without the help of a very large
number of people, very few of which I have actually even met.

First of all, there is the crew at
\href{http://6502.org}{6502.org}\index{6502.org} who not only helped me build a
6502 computer, but also introduced me to Forth. Tali Forth would not exist
without their inspiration, support, and feedback.

A special mention goes to Mike Barry\index{Barry, Mike}, who repeatedly
suggested improvements to the assembler code, saving everybody dozens of bytes
and (by now) thousands of cycles.
